### What I learned

During this project, I focused on solidifying my understanding of **CSS Flexbox** for layout and **responsive design** principles. I particularly reinforced:

* **Centering elements** using `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` on the `body`.
* Applying **consistent styling and spacing** with careful use of `margin` and `padding` to create a clean, balanced look.
* Implementing **hover states** for interactive elements to provide clear visual feedback to the user.
* The importance of **semantic HTML** for better accessibility and overall code structure.
* **Importing custom fonts** using `@font-face` for a more personalized design.

One key improvement I made was moving from `<br>` tags to using **CSS `gap` property** within a flex container (`.links-container`) for spacing between buttons. This approach is much cleaner and provides more control over the layout.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue exploring:

* More advanced **CSS animations and transitions** to add subtle dynamic effects.
* Further refining **accessibility features**, such as more comprehensive ARIA attributes for interactive elements where applicable.
* Deepening my knowledge of **CSS variables** for more maintainable and scalable styling.
* Potentially implementing a **dark/light mode toggle** to enhance user experience.

### Useful resources

-   [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) - This helped me with code review and suggestions for improving my CSS spacing and overall best practices. I really liked its specific feedback on replacing `<br>` tags with `gap`.
